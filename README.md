# HADES
HADES is a special little tool that adds (will add) functionality to Serif's Affinity Designer.

## What does HADES stand for?

HADES stands for **(h)Affinity Designer Enrichment Suite**. The name has been ripped off of Live Enhancement Suite (https://enhancementsuite.me), but according to a panel of judges (me), HADES sounds much cooler than LES. So, "get rekt".
Also, it's "Enrichment", not "Enhancement".

## Feature list, or rather an "idea list"

HADES is still in the "proof-of-concept" stage, so its feature list could be best described as an empty set. Having a list of things that could be added is still rather nice, though:

* Construction guides - a miniature version of GeoGebra within Affinity Designer
* WCAG contrast ratio calculator
* Nonlinear distortion, particularly free/quadrilateral distortion
