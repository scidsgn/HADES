# HADES
HADES is a special little tool that adds (will add) functionality to Serif's Affinity Designer.

## What does HADES stand for?

HADES stands for **(h)Affinity Designer Enrichment Suite**. The name has been ripped off of Live Enhancement Suite (https://enhancementsuite.me), but according to a panel of judges (me), HADES sounds much cooler than LES. So, "get rekt".
Also, it's "Enrichment", not "Enhancement".

## How to use HADES

* Launch `HADES.exe`.
* Open a document in Affinity Designer (as a tab within Affinity's window - HADES can't recognize detached document windows just yet).
* Put your mouse cursor over the canvas.
* Press `Ctrl-Q`.
* Profit!

## Feature list, or rather an "idea list"

HADES is still in the "proof-of-concept" stage, so its feature list is not yet complete. Having a list of things that could be added is still rather nice, though:

* Color-related features:
  * ✔️ WCAG contrast ratio calculator
  * ❌ Color harmony generator (Designer requires you to use swatches to generate color harmonies)
  * ❌ Color blindness preview (B&W, emulating protanopia, deuteranopia, etc.)
* ❌ Lighting helper - a material preview ball within Designer
* ❌ Construction guides - a miniature version of GeoGebra within Affinity Designer
* ❌ Nonlinear distortion, particularly free/quadrilateral distortion
