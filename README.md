# HADES
HADES is a special little tool that adds (will add) functionality to Serif's Affinity Designer.

## What does HADES stand for?

HADES stands for **(h)Affinity Designer Enhancement Suite**. The name has been ripped off of Live Enhancement Suite (https://enhancementsuite.me), but according to a panel of judges (me), HADES sounds much cooler than LES. So, "get rekt".
